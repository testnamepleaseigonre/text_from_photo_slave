4. Discussion

Over the past few years many studies have investigated HAR using smartphones. The reviewed literature
provides detailed descriptions of essential aspects of data collection, data processing, and activity
classification. The studies have been conducted with one or more objectives. e.g., to limit technological
imperfections (e.g.. no GPS signal reception indoors), to minimize computational requirements (e.g., online
systems), and to maximize classification accuracy (all studies). Our review summarizes most frequently
used methods and offers available alternatives. We do not however identify any one ultimate activity
recognition procedure, and we doubt that one even exists. This results in part from the complexity of the
task. Different studies use different activities, signal processing techniques. and classifiers, and each likely
suffers from specific potential drawbacks.

Some of our concerns relate to the quality of the collected data. While datasets are usually collected in
laboratory settings, there is little evidence that algorithms trained using data from these controlled settings

generalize to free-living conditions [69.70]. In free-living settings. such aspects as duration, frequency, and
