2. Understanding Water Usage

For a domestic setting, there are a variety of questions that can be asked, which can lead to insights
about the water use of a household at different levels of granularity:

- How much water is being used?

- What water is being used—is it hot or cold water, fresh water or grey water?

- When is water being used—how does the water use change over the day, week and seasons?

- | Why is water being used—what are the activities related to water use?

- Where is water being used—at which fixture or fixture type is water being abstracted from? Are
these indoor or outdoor uses?

- Who is using the water—in a multi-occupancy household or building, how can water use be
attributable to individuals?

When unravelling insights about domestic water use, it is obvious that not all questions may
be relevant for all stakeholders and that different exploitations may require a specific water usage
contextualisation to be obtained.

From a water utility perspective, there are different motivations as to why obtaining insights
into household level information is important. At the most basic level, water usage information on
individual households is important for billing purposes. Aggregate monthly or even yearly water
usage information may be sufficient for water utilities to obtain adequate compensation for their
domestic water supply. Moreover, in order to achieve water distribution network efficiencies and
to understand investment levels, the relative costs and benefits of consumption are required; these
can only be estimated by determining households’ water use [10]. This, in turn, impacts on water
pricing mechanisms. This information is useful to manage resource constraints and future demands.
From end-use analysis, utilities can gain insights into how new generation appliances will positively
affect demand, and can thereby avoid oversupply before it is needed. Having information of water
