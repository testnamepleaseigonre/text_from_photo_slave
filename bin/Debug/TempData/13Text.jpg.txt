5.2.2. Data Fusion

In general, the classification of fused data can yield better results than the classification over
single data sources [59]. A promising direction of investigation is given by the nexus between energy
consumption, water consumption, and human presence ina house (also gas metering could be an
additional data source). In an extreme example, a 50% classification between laundry and gardening
could be better disambiguated by the analysis of instant energy consumption given that one of the
two activities uses energy and water at the same time. An example of the nexus between energy and
water is presented in Reference [60]. In that paper, the authors leverage electricity non-intrusive load
monitoring (NILM) to acquire water disaggregation as a set of water/energy correlated states.

5.2.3. Working at Scale

Applying standard rates derived from sample studies is misleading because of the high variability
in water use from one customer to another, even among customers with a similar infrastructure and
social-economic profile. The model extracted from a single houseâ€™s data is limited, and does not
leverage the information hidden in the broader population. What we consider parameters for a single
house (pipe size, extension of parcel, number of rooms, habits of tenants, etc.) could be considered
as independent variables in a broader model, comprising a full set of properties in a city or region.
The collection of massive datasets for an entire city or region is, nowadays, technically feasible and
possible to maintain in the long term. Hence, an interesting research question is to build and evaluate
large-scale models.

6. Conclusions

Non-intrusive water disaggregation is a valuable approach for estimating fixture-specific water
consumption, while keeping installation costs affordable, and, at the same time, the underlying
complexity of processing remains manageable. We have presented a review of water disaggregation
methods that make use of either mono-modal sensing or multi-modal sensing (e.g., combining different
variables, such as water flow, pressure, efc.). The result of our review can be summarized in the
following conclusions:
